  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The DevOps has two main parts, one for the PoC/Demo and one for the blog. For those that ended up here to only learn how to run the PoC please look at the <a href="https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/in4315/2022-2023/sa-team5">main README in the GitLab repo</a>. And for the remainder of the readers that still have an ornate interest in DevOps, CI/CD, or general automation we invite them to read on! First as mentioned we discuss the demo, and then we move on to the blog for those that are especially interested.</p>

<h1 id="releasing-a-demo">Releasing a demo</h1>
<p>The PoC exists to show that the space based architecture works nicely for high availability, the simplest manner to showcase this is through a demo running inside a docker environment.
Right now there is a single command that can be used to start the showcase, this is done through a docker compose file.</p>

<p>The following image showcases the setup of the docker containers and how they communicate:
<img src="/assets/demo-setup.drawio.png" alt="Docker container setup" /></p>

<p>As you can see the backend is in the form of a double setup of the train scheduler and in this case connected through a singular PostgreSQL database. Normally this database synchronization layer would consist out of separated databases, this could be done with PostgreSQL, but this is difficult to set up in such a way that a single command can run the whole demo. The data generator and frontend are there to showcase that the system actually works and one of the backend spaces can be shutdown without affecting the frontend.</p>

<p>All of this can be run with a single command in the root folder of this project:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd infra &amp;&amp; sudo docker compose up
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To stop the containers you can press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code>, and can be pressed again to force shutdown instead of shutting down gracefully.</p>

<h2 id="dockerizing-and-troubles-of-mono-repos">Dockerizing and troubles of mono repos</h2>
<p>As expected to be able to run in docker all our developed programs require a Dockerfile, right now the docker compose uses this to build all images locally. There is also the possibility to pull images from the GitLab container registry. All the projects are inside the same git repository it is necessary to handle it in a way of a small mono repo. Normally versioning would be troublesome in a mono repo but because we use docker images this can be used as a versioning system. To prevent wastage of runner agent minutes and faster merging of changes only the related pipelines run for a merge request. The container registry receives updated versions of the docker images when these land on the main branch, this is also done by the CI/CD pipelines.</p>

<p>Of course all the Java code has their own built pipelines that are fired off and have to pass for a PR to be accepted. The checks consist out of Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs and a Jacoco coverage report.</p>

<h1 id="releasing-a-blog">Releasing a blog</h1>
<p>The blog you are reading right now is also published via a CI/CD of course, the actual version you are reading now is the one that is also on the main branch. Merging to main does depend on a test pipeline, this is a two stage pipeline. First there is a build stage, this means pushing broken builds ends gets caught in this stage, making clear where a problem is. This also prevents the next stage from running, this was a late addition to the pipeline, which uploads the current proposed website to the test URL. This is very useful because this allows others to quickly view your proposed changes without needing to build it on their machines, even allowing you to see changes on mobile devices. In the end this made it easier and faster to merge changes and decide on changes because it took away a large barrier in viewing the changes.</p>

<p>Just as with the program pipelines, only actual changes to the blog trigger the CI/CD pipeline. This setup prevents from wasting precious CI/CD agent minutes and allows for faster merging of features unrelated to the blog.</p>
