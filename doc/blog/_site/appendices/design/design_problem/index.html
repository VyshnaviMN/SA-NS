    <ol>
  <li>
    <p>Operation Disruption: Severe delays, cancellations, and annoyance for customers can occur due to various reasons, such as technical issues, unexpected maintenance, or weather conditions. Hence, the NS system should have a highly available architecture with redundancy built into its design. The system should also have robust monitoring and alerting systems that can identify issues quickly and allow for prompt resolution. The system must also have adequate backup and disaster recovery procedures to ensure that the system can recover from any disruptions as soon as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increased Number of Commuters/Passengers: To address this challenge, the NS system should be optimized for performance and speed, allowing it to handle the increased traffic and demand during peak periods. The system should be scalable, allowing it to handle the increased traffic volumes. The system must also have robust testing procedures to ensure that any updates or modifications do not introduce new bugs or issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security Breaches and GDPR Compliance: As a critical infrastructure for the Netherlands, the NS system is a prime target for cyber attacks that can harm NS and its customers. To address this challenge, the system must have robust security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and encryption to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. The system must also comply with GDPR regulations, ensuring that customer data is secure and that data privacy is protected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>System Operation 24/7: The NS system operates 24/7, which increases the probability of system failures and requires a more extensive time frame to acknowledge and repair issues. Thus, the system should have 24/7 monitoring and alerting systems that can identify and resolve issues promptly. The system must also have adequate backup and disaster recovery procedures to ensure that the system can recover from any disruptions as soon as possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, the NS system faces various challenges that can impact its design and development. By considering the above challenges and taking appropriate measures, such as designing a highly available architecture, optimizing the system for performance and speed, and implementing robust security measures, the NS system can deliver high-quality and reliable train services to its customers while mitigating any potential risks or disruptions.</p>
