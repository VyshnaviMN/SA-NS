<p>Below, we present the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the system. Without these definitions it will be hard to measure the successfulness the implemented Proof-Of-Concept (PoC) and the project as a whole:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Stability: A stable system guarantees that the NS system operates as planned, with no crashes or unexpected downtime. For a transportation service provider like NS, stability is critical since any disruption in operation can result in severe delays, cancellations, and annoyance for customers. A reliable system also prevents data loss and allows transactions to be executed without mistakes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scalability: Given the increasing tends in the country’s population { % cite statistics % } as long as the establishment of the pre-covid touristic flow, the NS system is required to be scalable in order to meet the customer needs. As NS’s customer base grows, the system should be in a position to handle increased traffic and workload. Scalability is significant to ensure that the system does not get overcrowded or delayed and that users have easy access to the service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security: NS handles sensitive customer information, financial data and passenger travel plans. Therefore,a potential security breach could harm both customers and the company (in terms of heavy fines, reputational damage etc.). Moreover, NS comprises several Industrial Control Systems (ICS) which ensure the operation of the network. Security breaches on these systems could be detrimental on a national scale. Furthermore, “transport of persons and goods by (main) railway infrastructure” is considered a critical process of category-B and a part of the critical infrastructure of the Netherlands { % cite critical % }</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Availability: Trains are operation throughout the country almost 24/7. Thus, there is a need for the system to remain operational and available to users at all times. Delays or service disruptions cause discomfort and financial loss to the company and harm customer satisfaction</p>
  </li>
</ul>
