<p>Space-based architecture (SBA) is a design method that organizes the system around isolated and independent functional units known as “spaces”. Each space has its own logic, data, and interface. Spaces interact with each other using message passing and a virtualized middleware. The architecture enables a high degree of isolation and autonomy, making the system easier to develop and deploy <a class="citation" href="#sba_general">(“Software Architecture Patterns: Space-Based Architecture,” 2023)</a>.</p>

<p>The first law of Software Architecture stated in <a class="citation" href="#richards2020fundamentals">(Richards &amp; Ford, 2020)</a> is “Everything is a trade-off in software architecture.” Space-Based Architecture (SBA) enables the NS system to handle large amounts of real-time data and ensures availability and scalability. By using a combination of in-memory storage and persistent storage, SBAs provide both high performance and data durability. In a SBA, the system is composed of a large number of loosely coupled nodes that communicate with each other using a shared memory space. However, SBA can also introduce additional complexity, especially when it comes to managing data consistency and ensuring proper coordination between nodes. Though SBA is a powerful tool for building a highly scalable and available system, it requires careful consideration of trade-offs between performance, complexity, and maintainability.</p>

<p>According to <a class="citation" href="#richards2020fundamentals">(Richards &amp; Ford, 2020)</a>, some of the metrics of SBA include high agility, easy deployment, high performance, highly scalable, low ease of development, and expensive and time-consuming for testing purposes.</p>
