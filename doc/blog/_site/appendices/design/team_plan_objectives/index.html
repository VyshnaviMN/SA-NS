<p>Integrating all the individual goals into the team’s objectives is important to ensure there is a vision into what the project should become. Our team aimed to acquire knowledge on developing a high-quality software architecture that meets the requirements of stakeholders while having the ability to be flexible and adaptable to accommodate future changes and enhancements. We intended to explore and incorporate the fundamental principles of secure software design into our project. We also liked to gain a comprehensive understanding of diverse complex architectures and be able to have a better view of how design decisions impact time-to-market. Also, we were planning to investigate various quality attributes and implement proof of concept to validate the feasibility of our proposed system.</p>

<p>Our objectives remained steady throught this project. We did not make any updates during the Midterm deliverable.</p>

<p>Our final assessment of the team’s results in terms of the initially defined rubrics is that we managed to fullfill them. Specifically, we performed successfully the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designed systems in such the deploy replicate services in case of system crash ensuring high availability for users.</li>
  <li>Designed more complex architectures that still allow for extensions in different layers and offer good scalability with future proof planning</li>
  <li>Identified potential design patterns and best practices in software architecture</li>
  <li>Obtained better knowledge on software architecture principles that helped us understand how real life systems inter-operate, integrate and perform</li>
  <li>Understanded the current state of the software architecture to identify any bottleneck or areas for improvement</li>
  <li>Gained more experience in making a good PoC</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, we consider that the team succefully met the initial project rubrics and all team members learned and improved their skills and knowledge during this project.</p>
